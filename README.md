# LendingLibrary

![lendinglibrarygif](https://github.com/trav15/trav15.github.io/blob/master/img/lendinglibraryjs.gif)

A CMS for a lending library that tracks a list of items that are available and who has an item that is checked out. Users can borrow items as well as donate new items. 

**Added Javascript** to add dynamically rendered views upon welcome and utilize an internal API.

This is my Rails project for the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) Full Stack Web Developer Online program.
